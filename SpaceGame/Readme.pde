Brief description of the game developed 1/2 sentences:
Space Game is a fun spaceship game where you fight aliens, avoid missiles, and go through barriers that show up more 
often as you kill aliens. Grab power-ups to get more missiles and try to get the highest score!


Keystrokes/Mouse:
- AWSD or the arrow keys for movement
- Spacebar to shoot missiles
- Backspace to pause game
- Mouse click to navigate the menu

Known bugs/problems:
- if backspace is pressed at the start screen or game over screen, the Pause menu appears when the game starts, but the game isn't actually paused.
- occasionally, a barrier may not spawn right away when starting a new game (difficult to reproduce).
- deltaTime is not passed to the Alien Ship/Missiles, which may cause problems if the framerate is set higher than expected.
